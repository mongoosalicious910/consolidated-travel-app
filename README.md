## The Problem

Planning a group trip means juggling Google Docs, spreadsheets, Venmo threads, screenshot dumps, and 47 browser tabs. Nobody knows what's booked, what's suggested, or who's over budget.

## Our Solution

A single collaborative workspace for every trip, powered by AI:

- **AI Trip Builder** — Describe your trip ("5 days in Tokyo, food-heavy, $2500 budget") and get a full day-by-day itinerary generated instantly
- **Smart Email Import** — Paste a booking confirmation email and AI extracts the hotel, flight, or activity into your itinerary automatically
- **AI Budget Analysis** — One-click spending analysis with actionable tips ("You've spent 60% of your budget on hotels — consider hostels for the last 2 nights")
- **Real-time Collaboration** — Invite friends as editors or viewers with role-based permissions
- **Flight Search** — Compare flights directly in the app
- **Shareable Links** — Generate public read-only links for anyone to view the itinerary

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Tech | Why |
|---|---|---|
| **Framework** | Next.js 16 (App Router) | Fullstack React with server components, API routes, middleware |
| **Database** | Supabase (Postgres) | Auth, row-level security, instant REST API |
| **AI** | OpenAI GPT-4.1 | Structured JSON output for reliable itinerary generation |
| **Styling** | Tailwind CSS | Rapid UI development with consistent design tokens |
| **Auth** | Supabase Auth + middleware | Session-based auth with protected routes |
| **Deployment** | Vercel | Zero-config Next.js hosting with edge functions |

## Architecture Highlights

- **Server Components + API Routes** — Server components for initial data fetching, API routes for mutations. No client-side Supabase credentials for writes.
- **Admin Client Pattern** — A `supabase-admin` client using the service role key bypasses RLS for server-side operations, while the browser client respects row-level security.
- **Role Enforcement at Two Layers** — Every write API route checks the user's trip role (owner/editor/viewer). The UI also hides edit controls for viewers, but the API is the source of truth.
- **AI with Structured Output** — `askAIJSON<T>()` uses OpenAI's JSON mode to return typed, parseable responses — no fragile regex or markdown parsing.
- **Middleware Auth Guard** — `middleware.ts` redirects unauthenticated users away from protected routes before any page code runs.
